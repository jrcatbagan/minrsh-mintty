This project contains a simple implementation of an application layer protocol providing 
a user with remote shell access.  There are three main programs that are of main interest.  
The first is minrsh which is the backend client, minrshd which is the server program, and 
mintty is a GUI implemented in Qt C++ encapsulating the backend client.

In a general sense, minrsh refers to the application layer protocol.  Aside from 
providing users with remote shell access, it also encrypts communications using AES-128.  
minrsh is also referred to as the client program.

The main motivation for this project was to understand the fundamentals of application 
layer protocols in TCP/IP networking.
